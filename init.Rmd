# Insight in the economy of an Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game using the example of Guild Wars 2

Using the data science lifecycle of **plan**, **data**, **model** and **deployment**, I want to provide insights into many aspects of data science, programming in R and the world of the online game Guild Wars 2.

## Intro

Malcolm Forbes once said, "Money isn't everything as long as you have enough of it".
Sure, money doesn't buy happiness, but it can buy a lot of things. This is not only true for the real world, but especially in online games, where micro transactions and payed services have become the new normal. 

More and more games give you the choice to invest a lot of time *or* a lot of money. Both ways you'll somehow achieve the goal of the game faster. In some games you can even exchange digital goods for real money.

To get to the point, having digital currency in games can save you time, stress and even real money.

There are multiple ways to earn money in games.
Often you'll get on with just playing the game and getting some money from enemies, but for buying the *good* stuff, one needs a lot more money. 

One way may be farming, which means hunting special items in high amounts and selling them to other players. Here's the question, which items are worth collecting and can be sold for which prices?

Another way is buying items from other players and reselling them with a higher price tag, just like in the real world.
Many games have auction houses where those transactions can be made. For this type of income one needs to know what to buy when, which prices are low or high, and when to sell for which amount.

For this project my example of game will be Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2 was published in 2012 by NCSoft. There are no monthly fees and the basic game is free to play since 2015. It is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, meaning a lot of people playing in parallel in an online world. There are over 20.000 items that can be collected and many of them can be sold and bought at the auction house, called the trading post.

[trading post]("images/Trading_Post_home.jpg")

This is a picture of the auction house. There are many different types of items (Armor, Weapons, ...)

To make one thing clear, there are already a lot of web pages offering this or similar kind of services like [GW2Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/tradingpost) or [GW2TP](https://de.gw2tp.com/). 
This should only be a fun project exploring the R language, data science and the Guild Wars API.

## Identify variables

For making the most out of our data, we can try to identify some important variables.

1. For buying low and selling high, we need to know everything about the `prices` like average, mean and quantiles.
2. Where is the highest `difference` between buy and sell `prices`?
2. Are there any `outliers` that are must-buys?
3. What is the `quantity` of items on the market? 
4. Are there any special `times` when people buy/sell?
5. Investing in one item, what is the `return of investment (ROI)`?


## Metrics

Currently I'm really inexperienced with the auction market. I just buy the items I need.

The goal is to earn at least `18 gold and 6 silver` just by buying/selling items that the exploration/model identifiers as highest ROI.
This is the current values of `1$`.



## Getting started

### Acquire data

#### Guild Wars API


https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main

some text here and reference to scrape.Rmd

#### Overview

Load the data from CSV. 
We don't want to get that amount of data from the API again and again.

```{r}
dir <- getwd()
item_list_buys <- read.csv(paste(dir, "/gw2-all-buys.csv", sep = ""))
item_list_sells <- read.csv(paste(dir, "/gw2-all-sells.csv", sep = ""))
```

To get a quick impressions of the data, let's have a look at the rough numbers.

This is how the buyer data looks like:
```{r}
glimpse(item_list_buys)
```

The seller data has the same structure, just for all the sells. 
```{r}
glimpse(item_list_sells)
```

- Name: This is the name of the item.
- Description: Some items also have a description giving further information.
- Type: can be something like `armor`, `consumable`, `crafting material` and so on
- Rarity: There are 8 types of rarity from very common to very rare.
- Vendor_value: What a sell to a NPC dealer would yield.
- Id: Unique ID of the item.
- Icon: URL to a picture of the item
- Listings: How many players are offering this item to this price
- Unit_Price: What the player wants for this item (in copper)
- Quantity: How many offers of this items there are for this price.

Listings, Unit_Price and Quantity can be read together.

E.g. for the first data entry:

- There is 1 (`listings`) player 
- offering 17 (`quantity`) pieces of this item 
- for 168 (`unit_price`) copper each.

We'll learn more about copper shortly.


Compare total items of **all** buys and sells:

```{r}
nrow(item_list_buys)
nrow(item_list_sells)
```

Compare **unique** items of buys and sells:

```{r}
item_list_buys %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  count() %>% 
  first()

item_list_sells %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  count() %>% 
  first()
```

## Currency

![coin](images/coin.png)

Just like in the real world, where 100 cents are 1 Euro, 
the main currency in Guild Wars, coins, are separated into three units.

There is copper, silver and gold. All those values are the same and are automatically calculated by the game.

`
10.000 copper == 100 silver == 1 gold.
`

So we need to divide all values by `10.000` to display the price in gold, which is good for expensive goods and when we are searching for the upper prices.

There may be occasions where it makes more sense to look for silver or even copper.


### Filter items for expensive goods and display them:

Vendor prices are so low (copper range), that they appear as nearly zero in this chart.
If possible, it's always better to sell items on the action house instead of the vendor.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
item_list_sells_group <- item_list_sells %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(unit_price = mean(unit_price) / 10000, 
            vendor_value = mean(vendor_value) / 10000,
            type = unique(type),
            rarity = unique(rarity)) %>% 
  filter(unit_price > 5) %>% 
  arrange(desc(unit_price))

item_list_sells_group %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = name, y = unit_price, fill = rarity), stat="identity") +
  geom_point(aes(x = name, y = vendor_value), fill = "#000000", stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = item_list_sells_group$name)
  # geom_text(aes(label=vendor_value, x=name, y=vendor_value), hjust=0, vjust=0)

```

We'll come back to items and their value in much more detail later.


## The rarity of items

There are different rarities in Guild Wars that suggest how often this item will occur in the game:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rarities <- 
  c("Junk", "Basic", "Fine", "Masterwork", "Rare", "Exotic", "Ascended", "Legendary")

colors <- 
  c("Junk" = "#a3aeb9",
    "Basic" = "#000000",
    "Fine" = "#6a9cd9", 
    "Masterwork" = "#17911a", 
    "Rare" = "#f0cd25",
    "Exotic" = "#e9ad1a",
    "Ascended" = "#e64680",
    "Legendary" = "#53238a")

df <- data.frame(rarities)

df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = rarities, fill = rarities)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rarities) +
  scale_fill_manual("Rarity", values = colors)
```

What is obvious by the names, rarity on the left is in general more common than rarity on the right.

One important information is that a lot of very rare items (`Ascended` and `Legendary`) can't be sold to other players. That's the reason we may see more `Rare` and `Exotic` items being sold for high prices than those really rare ones.

In our dataset, we have the following distribution:

```{r}
df <- item_list_sells %>% 
  count(rarity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = rarity, y = n, fill = rarity), stat='identity') +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = rarities) +
  scale_fill_manual("Rarity", values = colors)
```

## Types

bla bla more text

```{r}
df <- item_list_sells %>% 
  count(type) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

df %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = type, y = n, fill = type), stat='identity') 
```

.................



Search for outliers:

```{r}

# render boxplot with outliers
item_list_sells %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = factor(rarity), y = unit_price, fill = factor(type))) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
